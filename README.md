# Welcome to Maxim's Blog Demo

This is a platform to host my personal tech blog that I want to start. This is only a demo for now because I recently decided to change around what I used for the backend of this project and is not ready to go into 'production'.

Nevertheless, the look-and-feel is going to be more or less the same so I wanted to put this out here as a type of MVP for the project.
This version of the project has a Firebase backend, but I am thinking about maybe moving to something like MongoDB instead.
